<p>This document provides a comprehensive set of Obstetrics and Gynecology multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with detailed explanations to aid medical students in their exam preparation. Each question is followed by a clear and concise explanation outlining the reasoning behind the correct answer and addressing key concepts related to the topic.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Arabic text in the provided image is irrelevant to the MCQs and has been disregarded.</p>
<p><strong>Section I: Normal Labor</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Diagonal conjugate diameter in the pelvis:</strong><br>
a. Is a diameter for the pelvic outlet<br>
b. Equals 11 cm<br>
c. Could not be evaluated clinically<br>
d. All of the above<br>
<strong>e. None of the above</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: e. None of the above</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  The diagonal conjugate is a diameter of the <strong>pelvic inlet</strong>, not the outlet. It typically measures around <strong>12.5 cm</strong>, not 11 cm.  It <strong>can be evaluated clinically</strong> through vaginal examination.</p>
<p><strong>2) The relation of different fetal parts to each another is defined as:</strong><br>
a. Presentation of the fetus<br>
b. Lie of the fetus<br>
<strong>c. Attitude of the fetus</strong><br>
d. Position of the fetus</p>
<p><strong>Answer: c. Attitude of the fetus</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attitude:</strong> Refers to the relationship of fetal parts to each other (e.g., flexion, extension).</li>
<li><strong>Presentation:</strong> Refers to the fetal part entering the pelvis first (e.g., cephalic, breech).</li>
<li><strong>Lie:</strong> Refers to the relationship of the long axis of the fetus to the long axis of the mother (e.g., longitudinal, transverse).</li>
<li><strong>Position:</strong> Refers to the relationship of a designated fetal part (usually the occiput in cephalic presentations) to the maternal pelvis (e.g., LOA, ROP).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3) The smallest longitudinal diameter of fetal head is:</strong><br>
a. Biparietal diameter<br>
b. Occipitofrontal diameter<br>
c. Bitemporal diameter<br>
<strong>d. Suboccipitobregmatic diameter</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: d. Suboccipitobregmatic diameter</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The suboccipitobregmatic diameter, measuring about 9.5 cm, is the smallest longitudinal diameter of the fetal head. It presents in a well-flexed head and is crucial for successful vaginal delivery.</p>
<p><strong>4) The fetus is in a third position when the back is:</strong><br>
<strong>a. Posterior and to the right</strong><br>
b. Anterior and to the left<br>
c. Anterior and to the right<br>
d. Posterior and to the left</p>
<p><strong>Answer: a. Posterior and to the right</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  Fetal positions are described based on the location of the occiput in relation to the maternal pelvis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First position:</strong>  Occiput anterior and to the left (LOA)</li>
<li><strong>Second position:</strong>  Occiput anterior and to the right (ROA)</li>
<li><strong>Third position:</strong> Occiput posterior and to the right (ROP)</li>
<li><strong>Fourth position:</strong> Occiput posterior and to the left (LOP)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5) If diagonal conjugate is “a” cm, then obstetric conjugate will be:</strong><br>
a. “a”+1.5 cm<br>
b. “a” +2 cm<br>
<strong>c. “a” - 2 cm</strong><br>
d. “a” +1 cm</p>
<p><strong>Answer: c. “a” - 2 cm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The obstetric conjugate (true conjugate) is estimated by subtracting 1.5-2 cm from the diagonal conjugate measurement. This is because the obstetric conjugate is the shortest anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic inlet and cannot be directly measured clinically.</p>
<p><strong>6) The longest presenting diameter in cephalic presentation is:</strong><br>
a. Biparietal diameter<br>
<strong>b. Mentovertical</strong><br>
c. Suboccipto-bregmatic<br>
d. Submento-bregmatic</p>
<p><strong>Answer: b. Mentovertical</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The mentovertical diameter extends from the chin (mentum) to the highest point of the vertex. This diameter is presented in a brow presentation and is the longest presenting diameter in cephalic presentations.</p>
<p><strong>7) The INCORRECT statement relating to ischial spines is :</strong><br>
a. They mark the beginning of the forward curve of the birth canal.<br>
b. They lie between the greater and lesser sciatic notches.<br>
c. The internal pudendal nerve lies in close relation to the spines<br>
<strong>d. They are very prominent in the normal female pelvis.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: d. They are very prominent in the normal female pelvis.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  While ischial spines are important landmarks in the pelvis, they are <strong>not very prominent</strong> in a normal female pelvis. Their prominence can indicate a narrowed mid-pelvis, potentially complicating labor.</p>
<p><strong>8) Which is true about the diagonal conjugate?</strong><br>
a. 11.5 cm<br>
<strong>b. can be measured clinically</strong><br>
c. a diameter of pelvic outlet<br>
d. none of the above</p>
<p><strong>Answer: b. can be measured clinically</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The diagonal conjugate can be measured clinically through vaginal examination by palpating the sacral promontory and the lower border of the symphysis pubis.</p>
<p><strong>9) Clinical pelvimetry can estimate the following EXCEPT:</strong><br>
a. Diagonal conjugate diameter<br>
b. Inter-ischial diameter<br>
<strong>c. Transverse diameter of the inlet</strong><br>
d. Subpubic angle</p>
<p><strong>Answer: c. Transverse diameter of the inlet</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While clinical pelvimetry can assess various pelvic dimensions, it cannot directly measure the transverse diameter of the inlet.  This diameter can be estimated through imaging studies.</p>
<p><strong>10) Engagement is:</strong><br>
<strong>a. Passage of engaging diameters through pelvic inlet</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Engagement refers to the passage of the widest presenting part of the fetal head through the pelvic inlet. It signifies that the fetal head has entered the true pelvis and is a crucial milestone in labor progression.</p>
<p><strong>11) The plane of least pelvic dimension passes by the following EXCEPT:</strong><br>
a. The lower border of symphysis pubis<br>
b. The ischial spines<br>
c. Lower border of 5th sacrum vertebrae<br>
<strong>d. Ischial tuberosities</strong><br>
e. All of the above<br>
f. None of the above</p>
<p><strong>Answer: d. Ischial tuberosities</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  The plane of least pelvic dimension (midplane) is defined by landmarks including the lower border of the symphysis pubis, ischial spines, and lower border of the 5th sacral vertebra. The ischial tuberosities are not part of this plane.</p>
<p><strong>12) Smallest diameter of pelvic Inlet:</strong><br>
<strong>a. Obs conjugate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The obstetric conjugate (true conjugate) is the smallest diameter of the pelvic inlet and is crucial for the passage of the fetal head.</p>
<p><strong>13) Longest diameter in cephalic presentation:</strong><br>
<strong>a. Mento-vertical</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  As explained previously, the mentovertical diameter is the longest presenting diameter in cephalic presentations and is seen in brow presentation.</p>
<p><strong>14) Parturition:</strong><br>
<strong>a. The Process of Normal Labor and The Powers</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Parturition refers to the entire process of labor and childbirth, encompassing the stages of labor and the forces involved (uterine contractions, maternal effort).</p>
<p><strong>15) Engagement of the fetal head by passage of the BPD through:</strong><br>
a. Plane of least pelvic dimensions<br>
<strong>b. Plane of the inlet</strong><br>
c. Plane of widest pelvic dimensions<br>
d. Plane of the outlet</p>
<p><strong>Answer: b. Plane of the inlet</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Engagement specifically refers to the passage of the fetal head’s biparietal diameter (BPD) through the plane of the pelvic inlet.</p>
<p><strong>16) The INCORRECT statement for delivery of the placenta:</strong><br>
a. Catheterization of the bladder should be carried out when<br>
separation is delayed<br>
<strong>b. The earliest sign of delivery of the placenta includes a gush of<br>
vaginal bleeding</strong><br>
c. Normally it takes I-2 hours in primigravida<br>
d. Sign of placental descent include a suprapubic bulge</p>
<p><strong>Answer: b. The earliest sign of delivery of the placenta includes a gush of vaginal bleeding</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  While a gush of bleeding often occurs with placental delivery, the <strong>earliest sign</strong> is typically <strong>lengthening of the umbilical cord</strong>. The other options are true regarding placental delivery.</p>
<p><strong>17) Onset of labour is indicated by:</strong><br>
a. Painful uterine contractions<br>
b. Dilatation of internal os<br>
c. Formation of bag of waters<br>
<strong>d. All of the above</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: d. All of the above</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> All the options mentioned can signify the onset of labor. Regular, painful contractions, cervical changes (dilatation and effacement), and rupture of membranes are cardinal signs of labor initiation.</p>
<p><strong>18) The average duration of normal labour in primigravida in stage II is:</strong><br>
a. 4 hours<br>
<strong>b. 1-2 hours</strong><br>
c. 10-30 minutes<br>
d. 15 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Answer: b. 1-2 hours</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  The second stage of labor (full dilatation to fetal expulsion) typically lasts for 1-2 hours in primigravidas. It is usually shorter in multiparous women.</p>

<p><strong>20) Sign of placental separation:</strong><br>
<strong>a. Elongation of the umbilical cord</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  Lengthening of the umbilical cord is a reliable sign of placental separation. Other signs include a gush of vaginal bleeding, change in the shape of the uterus (becoming globular), and a rise in the fundus.</p>
<p><strong>21) The second stage of labour is defined as the time between:</strong><br>
a. Onset of labour and full dilatation of the cervix<br>
b. Dilatation of the cervix from 4 to 10 cm<br>
<strong>c. Full dilatation and delivery of the fetus</strong><br>
d. Delivery of the fetus and placenta</p>
<p><strong>Answer: c. Full dilatation and delivery of the fetus</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The second stage of labor commences with full cervical dilatation (10 cm) and ends with the delivery of the baby.</p>
<p><strong>22) Adding 7 days and subtracting 3 months:</strong><br>
<strong>a. Naegles formula</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Naegele’s rule is a standard method for estimating the expected date of delivery (EDD). It involves adding 7 days to the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) and subtracting 3 months.</p>
<p><strong>23) A non-pregnant female with a history of 4 pregnancies, one of which was a twin pregnancy:</strong><br>
<strong>a. G4, P4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The woman is G4P4:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gravida (G):</strong> Represents the total number of pregnancies, including the current one.</li>
<li><strong>Para §:</strong> Represents the number of births after 20 weeks gestation, regardless of whether the baby was born alive or stillborn.  Twins count as one birth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>24) During abdominal examination of the brow presentation:</strong><br>
<strong>b. The sinciput is felt higher than the occiput</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In a brow presentation, the fetal head is partially extended, leading to the sinciput (forehead) being higher than the occiput.</p>
<p><strong>25) The angle of inclination of the plane of pelvic Inlet with the horizon is approximately:</strong><br>
<strong>c. 55</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The plane of the pelvic inlet is angled approximately 55 degrees to the horizon. This angle is important for the descent of the fetal head during labor.</p>
<p><strong>26) Relation between different parts of fetus is termed:</strong><br>
<strong>c. Attitude</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  As previously explained, attitude describes the relationship of fetal parts to one another (e.g., flexion, extension).</p>
<p><strong>27) Shortest diameter of inlet in female pelvis is:</strong><br>
<strong>b. Obstetric conjugate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  The obstetric conjugate, also known as the true conjugate, is the shortest anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic inlet and is crucial for the passage of the fetal head.</p>
<p><strong>28) The anterior fontanelle (bregma) takes … months to close after birth:</strong><br>
<strong>c. 18 months</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The anterior fontanelle typically closes between 12-18 months after birth. Delayed closure can be associated with certain medical conditions.</p>
<p><strong>29) Denominator refers to:</strong><br>
<strong>a. Bony fixed point of reference on the presenting part</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The denominator is a bony landmark on the presenting part of the fetus used to describe its position in relation to the maternal pelvis. For example, in vertex presentation, the denominator is the occiput.</p>
<p><strong>30) The position where the mentum is directed anterior and to the left is:</strong><br>
<strong>a. Right mentoposterior</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In this position, the chin (mentum) is directed towards the mother’s right sacroiliac joint.</p>
<p><strong>31) The position where the sagittal suture is closer to the symphysis pubis is:</strong><br>
<strong>b. Posterior asynclitism</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  Asynclitism refers to the tilting of the fetal head in relation to the sagittal suture. In posterior asynclitism, the posterior parietal bone presents first.</p>
<p><strong>32) Which of the following is true about episiotomy?</strong><br>
<strong>a. It is done during crowning with uterine contractions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Episiotomy is a surgical incision made in the perineum to enlarge the vaginal opening. It is typically performed during crowning (when the fetal head is visible at the vaginal opening) to prevent uncontrolled tearing.</p>
<p><strong>33) Clinical evidence indicating the onset of the second stage of labour:</strong><br>
<strong>d. All of the above</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> As mentioned before, spontaneous bearing down, rupture of membranes, and the urge to defecate are all signs that mark the beginning of the second stage of labor.</p>
<p><strong>34) The second stage of labor involves:</strong><br>
<strong>d. Expulsion of fetus</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The primary event of the second stage of labor is the expulsion of the fetus from the birth canal.</p>
<p><strong>35) Factors that help in the descent of the presenting part during labor are all except:</strong><br>
<strong>d. Resistance from pelvic floor</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the pelvic floor muscles play a crucial role in supporting pelvic organs, they provide resistance to the descending fetus, which must be overcome for successful delivery. The other options are factors that aid in descent.</p>
<p><strong>36) The dermatomes of early true labor pains:</strong><br>
<strong>a. T10 – L1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The pain of early labor is primarily felt in the T10-L1 dermatomes due to visceral afferent fibers carrying pain signals from the contracting uterus and cervix.</p>
<p><strong>37) All are components of the Bishop score except:</strong><br>
<strong>a. Fetal membranes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The Bishop score assesses cervical favorability for induction of labor. It evaluates cervical dilatation, effacement, station, consistency, and position. Fetal membranes status is not a component of the Bishop score.</p>
<p><strong>38) All are true about the 3rd stage of labor except:</strong><br>
<strong>a. It lasts 1-2 hours in primi</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  The third stage of labor (delivery of the placenta) typically lasts for 5-30 minutes. A prolonged third stage (more than 30 minutes) can be associated with complications like postpartum hemorrhage.</p>
<p><strong>39) The INCORRECT statement relating to the plane of least pelvic dimensions is:</strong><br>
<strong>d. Its transverse diameter is 11 cm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The transverse diameter of the plane of least pelvic dimensions (midplane) is typically 10 cm, not 11 cm. The other statements regarding this plane are accurate.</p>

<p><strong>56) The first stage of labour:</strong><br>
<strong>c. Can be shortened by the use of oxytocin</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  Oxytocin can be used to augment labor by increasing the frequency and strength of uterine contractions, potentially shortening the first stage of labor.</p>
<p><strong>57) The following is true for Bandl’s ring:</strong><br>
<strong>c. Can be seen and felt</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Bandl’s ring is a pathological retraction ring that can be visible and palpable on abdominal examination. It indicates obstructed labor and requires urgent intervention.</p>
<p><strong>58) In normal vaginal delivery, the following are true EXCEPT:</strong><br>
<strong>b. Delivery of the posterior shoulder precedes the anterior one</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In normal vaginal delivery, the <strong>anterior shoulder is delivered first</strong>, followed by the posterior shoulder. The other options are true regarding normal vaginal delivery.</p>
<p><strong>59) During labour, liquor amnii serves the following functions EXCEPT:</strong><br>

<p><strong>63) About moulding:</strong><br>
<strong>a. Bones of the face and base of skull do not mould</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Moulding refers to the overlapping of fetal skull bones during labor to facilitate passage through the birth canal. The bones of the face and skull base are relatively fixed and do not participate in moulding.</p>
<p><strong>64) About passive events of labor in OA position:</strong><br>
<strong>c. internal rotation is the result of gutter shape and slope of the pelvis</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In an occipitoanterior (OA) position, the shape and slope of the pelvis guide the fetal head to internally rotate to an OA position for delivery.</p>
<p><strong>65) Which of the following is NOT required for the diagnosis of true labor?</strong><br>
<strong>d. bloody show</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  While bloody show can occur with labor, it is not a prerequisite for diagnosis. Rhythmic contractions and progressive cervical changes (dilatation and effacement) are essential for diagnosing true labor.</p>

<p><strong>73) Which of the following isn’t a determinant for the rotation of the head:</strong><br>
<strong>d. Analgesia</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While analgesia can affect labor progress, it does not directly influence the rotation of the fetal head. The shape of the pelvis, uterine contractions, and fetal size are key determinants of head rotation.</p>
<p><strong>74) Pain in early labour is limited to dermatomes:</strong><br>
<strong>a. T10 - L1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This question is a repetition of question 36.</p>
<p><strong>75) During the active phase of labour, the satisfactory cervical dilatation rate per hour in primigravida is:</strong><br>
<strong>a. 1 cm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In the active phase of labor, the cervix should dilate at least 1 cm per hour in primigravidas. A slower rate may indicate dysfunctional labor.</p>
<p><strong>76) Partogram is used to:</strong><br>
<strong>c. Assess the progress of labour</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A partogram is a graphical record of labor progress, including cervical dilatation, descent of the presenting part, and other relevant parameters. It is essential for monitoring labor and identifying potential complications.</p>
<p><strong>77) The average duration of stage II normal labour in primigravida is:</strong><br>

<p><strong>Q316) about VBAC:</strong><br>
<strong>a. Absolutely contraindicated in previous classical CS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  <strong>VBAC is absolutely contraindicated</strong> in women with a previous <strong>classical cesarean section</strong> (vertical incision in the upper part of the uterus). This type of incision carries a much higher risk of uterine rupture during labor.</p>
<p><strong>Q317) case, woman in labor with 4 cm dilated cervix and after 4 hours there is no progress</strong><br>
<strong>a. Most probably CS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Prolonged labor without cervical dilatation suggests failure to progress. In this case, a <strong>cesarean section</strong> is likely the most appropriate management.</p>
<p><strong>Q318) In the following, what is the disadvantage of lower segment Caesarean section?</strong><br>
a. More blood loss than classic type<br>
<strong>b. Increase liability for placental injury</strong><br>
c. Subsequent rupture uterus is more<br>
d. Injury of urinary bladder<br>
(B)</p>
<p><strong>Answer: (B)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A lower segment cesarean section carries a higher risk of <strong>placental injury</strong> because the placenta is often located in the lower part of the uterus.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  <strong>Intrauterine synechiae (Asherman’s syndrome)</strong> occurs when scar tissue forms inside the uterus, often following a D&amp;C procedure. This can lead to secondary amenorrhea (absence of menstruation). The FSH level of 6 IU/L is within the normal range, ruling out pituitary or ovarian failure.</p>
<p><strong>Q329) Compared with midline incision in CS, a Pfannestiel incision is characterized by all of the following EXCEPT:</strong><br>
<strong>a. Less bladder dissection</strong><br>
b. Decreased rates of fascial wound dehiscence<br>
c. Incomplete reperitonization<br>
d. Less blood loss</p>
<p><strong>Answer: (A)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A <strong>Pfannestiel incision</strong> (transverse incision in the lower abdomen) is associated with <strong>more bladder dissection</strong> than a midline incision because the incision is made horizontally across the lower abdomen, requiring more manipulation of the bladder. It does, however, offer other benefits, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Decreased rates of fascial wound dehiscence:</strong> The transverse incision heals stronger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incomplete reperitonization:</strong> The peritoneum (lining of the abdominal cavity) is not always sutured closed, potentially reducing adhesion formation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Less blood loss:</strong> The transverse incision involves less cutting through muscle layers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q330) Absolute indications of Caesarean section include all the following EXCEPT:</strong><br>
<strong>a. Marfan’s syndrome</strong><br>
b. Advanced cancer cervix<br>
c. Severe pelvic contraction<br>
d. Central placenta previa</p>
<p><strong>Answer: (A)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> As explained earlier, <strong>Marfan’s syndrome</strong> is not an absolute indication for cesarean section.</p>
<p><strong>Q331) Caesarean hysterectomy is advisable when there is</strong><br>
a. Uncontrollable postpartum haemorrhage<br>
b. Placenta accreta<br>
c. Gross uterine infection<br>
d. a&amp;b<br>
<strong>e. All of the above</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: (E)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>  <strong>Cesarean hysterectomy</strong> is a major surgery performed when other measures to control bleeding or infection fail. It is advisable in cases of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Uncontrollable postpartum hemorrhage:</strong> When bleeding cannot be controlled with other methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Placenta accreta:</strong> When the placenta is abnormally adherent to the uterine wall.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>12. During the delivery, the fetal head follows the pelvic axis. The axis is best described as:</strong></p>
<p><strong>C. A curved line, 1ST directed posteriorly then caudal.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The pelvic axis describes the path of least resistance for the fetal head through the pelvis. It’s a curved line:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Posteriorly directed:</strong>  The pelvic inlet is angled posteriorly.</li>
<li><strong>Caudally directed:</strong>  The head moves downwards towards the pelvic outlet.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>17. An unstable lie is related to all of the following EXCEPT:</strong></p>
<p><strong>E. Cervical fibroid.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> An unstable lie means the fetal lie changes frequently and doesn’t settle into a consistent position. This can be caused by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prematurity:</strong> A smaller fetus has more room to move within the uterus.</li>
<li><strong>Grand multiparity:</strong>  A uterus stretched by multiple pregnancies may have more space for fetal movement.</li>
<li><strong>Placenta previa:</strong> The placenta partially or completely covers the cervical opening, limiting fetal movement.</li>
